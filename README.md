# Project Title: Fully Dispersed Haar-like Filters for Feature Extraction of Face Images

## Description
This repository contains the MATLAB code and datasets for implementing the **Fully Dispersed Haar-like Filter** for feature extraction of face images. The goal of this project is to provide a Fully Dispersed Haar-like Filter for feature extraction, as proposed by **Z. Sedaghtjoo, H. Hosseinzadeh, and A. Shirzadi**.

## Contents
- **MATLAB Code**: The main algorithm implemented in MATLAB for feature Extraction of face images process.
- **Datasets**: Two data files containing the clutter and face images used in this project.
  - `Clutter2.mat`: Contains clutter data for training and testing.
  - `Pics.mat`: Contains face images for training and testing.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sedaghatjoo/fully-dispersed-Haar-like-filter.git

   ```

2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed to run the code. The required version is **MATLAB R2020b** or newer.

## Usage
1. Open the MATLAB script **Fully_Dispered_HaarLike.m**.
2. Load the dataset files by running:
   ```matlab
   load('Clutter2.mat');
   load('Pics.mat');
   ```
3. Run the script to start feature Extraction process..
4. View the results in the MATLAB workspace.

## Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions to improve the algorithm, code, or documentation. If you'd like to contribute, please:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. Make your changes and test them.
4. Create a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.
